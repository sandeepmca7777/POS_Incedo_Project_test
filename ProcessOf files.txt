Execute index.php file and pass data according to given format and it will gives exact output. 


My point-of-sale scanner program has several classes:
Terminal class in terminal.php
This class is an interface for scanning products and getting total cost (volume + unit) for products.

Invoice class in invoice.php
This class tallys the number of times each product is scanned and calculates the total cost of all scanned products.

Product class in product.php
Represents a product object. Contains information about that product's name, volume and unit prices.

Inventory class in inventory.php
Stores the products, including adding and removing products.

Listing class in listing.php
This class provides operations to update a product unit and volume costs and other information about the product, such
as whether the product is in the inventory.


NOTE:
I did not handle all possibie exceptions if someone tries inputting non-numeric or negative unit and volume prices, except for the add() method in Inventory class.
